         <p>I remember walking into certain spaces in my childhood and I remember how they affected how I felt and thought, whether in a positive way or a negative way. The impact that spaces have on people leads me as a designer to create spaces that will not only be enjoyed aesthetically on first impact but will function in their support of lives in the long term. This level of design does not come simply through matching colors and fabrics, but through an exhaustive study and understanding of how a space is to be used. Only when aesthetics and function are perfectly balanced, can interior design impact to its fullest extent.</p>
         <p>
            This fact compels me as a designer to pay special attention to the details, while keeping the big picture consistently before my eyes. My design goal is a wholistic design, that leaves no holes in the use of the space and leaves no senses untouched by the experience that is interior design

            My personal hobbies include drawing, hiking the appalachain trail, and going on long rambles with my yellow lab.
